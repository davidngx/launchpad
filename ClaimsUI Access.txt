[2/20/20, 8:54:40 AM] Lin, Shan: Hi Shawn, do you happen to know which doc solutions test environment ClaimsUI test points at?
[2/20/20, 8:57:53 AM] MAJOR, SHAWN: One minute, I’ll check
[2/20/20, 8:58:18 AM] Lin, Shan: thanks
[2/20/20, 8:58:52 AM] Lin, Shan: Btw, can I get a claims test account?
[2/20/20, 8:59:45 AM] Lin, Shan: Claims users are external and we worry that data power will have problems with AWS urls
[2/20/20, 9:00:16 AM] MAJOR, SHAWN: https://ete-docservices-bpm.libertyec.com/PMPubDocumentumServicesModuleWeb/sca/ClaimsListMetaWSExport
[2/20/20, 9:00:44 AM] Lin, Shan: Got it
[2/20/20, 9:02:55 AM] MAJOR, SHAWN: To get access to claims UI for testing yourself using your own enterprise ID, you can:

Submit Request IT form 3041 (AD) for these groups:

[2/20/20, 9:03:58 AM] Lin, Shan: Fantastic
[2/20/20, 9:06:11 AM] Lin, Shan: After getting these groups, all we need is go to claims webpage url and login?
[2/20/20, 9:08:35 AM] MAJOR, SHAWN: Yes, you can either navigate to Claims UI directly, or you can go through the SafecoNow portal page.

Direct (change the claim number): https://ete-claims.safeco.com/claimsui/detail?claimNumber=056309323
